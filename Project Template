# Project Overview

## Project Name

Covid-19 Data 

## Project Description

I will consume the Covid-19 API and allow users to specify countries by name to gather data about said Country. I.E- Population,Cases,Deaths, ETC.

## API and Data Sample


https://covid-api.mmediagroup.fr/v1   

{"Afghanistan": {"All": {"confirmed": 55617, "recovered": 48895, "deaths": 2433, "country": "Afghanistan", "population": 35530081, "sq_km_area": 652090}}

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Allow user to Search a country and click a Button to retrieve data.
- Data Pops up on the page.
- Allow User to navigate around the page (Home Screen Button, Covid-Cases Button that will guide you to said location upon a click) 

#### PostMVP  

- Once the user searches for a new country the old data no longer linger arounds and is replaced with the new country data.
- Create a interactive animation letting the user know corona has struck.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
